Building J-Ben
==============

Dependencies:

J-Ben is dependent on (at least) two different development packages.
* wxWidgets: J-Ben is being developed using wxWidgets 2.8.7.  It may and
  probably will work on slightly earlier versions, but I can't guarantee
  everything will work right.
* The Boost Libraries: J-Ben should work with boost 1.34.1 or later.

If building for Linux, you will also need a development package for:
* GTK+ 2: Tested using debian's libgtk2.0-dev package, version 2.12.1-1

Linux users:

Ensure you have the development packages for libboost and
wxWidgets installed.  Then, just "make".  There is no "make install" at this
time, sorry.  It will be added later.

Windows users:

While Linux building should be mostly non-problematic, the Windows
build support is NOT robust.  It's designed specifically for use with MinGW
without the MSYS environment.

If you want to give it a try, do the following:
* Ensure mingw's bin folder is in your path
* Install the coreutils and sed packages from the gnuwin32 project.
  This means the binaries and the dependencies.  You'll probably come across
  duplicate DLLs while unzipping these packages.  This should be okay, just
  keep the newer copy of any duplicate DLLs.
* Make sure the coreutils/sed binaries are in your path.
* Change the 4 variables in the "WINDOWS-SPECIFIC" below as needed
* build using the following command:
  mingw32-make PLATFORM=windows BUILD=<release|debug|profile>

Expert: Canadian Cross Linux->Windows builds
(Most people can safely skip this section.)

To attempt a "canadian cross" build, run:
   make CANUCK=1 PLATFORM=windows BUILD=<release|debug|profile> \
   CC=<cross-compiling gcc> CXX=<cross-compiling g++>
(This has not yet been tested; I'm working on it!)


Installing J-Ben
================

Currently there is no proper installer mechanism for the program; I've been
mostly focused on the program itself since it is still quite lacking in several
areas.  I will address installation at a future date.

For Windows users, adding a start menu shortcut should be a trivial affair, if
desired.  Just do it yourself.

For Linux users, you could add the program's directory to your path via your
~/.bashrc file, or you could make a script like the following:

#!/bin/sh
cd <path_to_jben>
./jben

Put that in /usr/bin or similar, do a chmod +x on it and that'll make things
simpler.
