CROSSPLATFORM NOTES:
J-Ben (formerly wxKanji and JKanji) was written and primarily tested on Debian GNU/Linux "sid".
The Windows build was compiled on the Debian system.  However, some steps had to be taken to make this work.

1. Install Wine
I configured Debian to install the latest Wine package from winehq.org's Debian repository via apt-get.
This -should- be self-explanatory.

2. Install MinGW via wine
There's two methods here.  One is to get a zip file of MinGW and set it up manually.
The other is to use the installer (which on Windows is the easier method), but if your Internet
connection is behind a proxy server, you may need to install a version of Internet Explorer first
and configure its proxy settings, since that's what the installer relies upon.

3. Set up Windows environment variables
Using Wine regedit, I created the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment and added the following string values:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\System="c:\\windows\\system32"
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\Temp="c:\\windows\\temp"
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\Path="c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system32;c:\\windows\\system;c:\\MinGW\\bin"

Replace c:\\MinGW\\bin with whatever your MinGW\bin path is.  Remember the double \'s.

4. Set up wxWidgets
This I COULD NOT DO using wine.  The makefile for MinGW gcc uses Windows commands which Wine does not provide.
Maybe doing a ./configure-type method might work, but I'm unsure how exactly to do that.  I'm unsure whether MSYS
works through Wine since it is available to allow that type of installation method.

In my case, I copied the source to a windows machine, ran gcc off of a thumb drive, copied the compiled wxWidgets
back to my thumb drive and then onto my Linux dev machine.

5. Make!
Unzip the Windows source code, then run "wine mingw32-make -f Makefile.msw BUILD=release UNICODE=1 SHARED=1".
That -should- be it!

UPDATE: NOT SO TRUE.  Things get to the linking stage, then they fall apart when trying to build with gcc via wine.
Ultimately I needed to build via MinGW on a real Windows platform.
