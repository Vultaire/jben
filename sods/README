This directory holds stroke order diagrams from KanjiCafe.com. J-Ben
uses the UTF-8/hex archives and supports both animated and static
stroke order diagrams.  These can either be downloaded from my site
at http://www.vultaire.net/software/jben/download.php (.zip and
.tar.bz2 format), or from Jim Rose's site at
http://www.kanjicafe.com/license.htm (.tar.gz format).

To use, you must decompress or "unzip" the archive file(s) you
downloaded into this directory.  This should create a folder called
sod-utf8-hex (or soda-utf8-hex for animated charts).  After doing
this, run J-Ben, go to the Configuration tab, and check the
appropriate stroke order option at the bottom of the window.
