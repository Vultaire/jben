J-Ben was written by Paul Goins.  It uses code from the im-ja and kanjipad
projects, and those portions are copyrighted by their original authors.
Code has also been directly contributed by Alain Bertrand.

I've had a lot of help writing this software from many people, and it
goes without saying that this list will not be conclusive.  However,
I want to try to give credit where credit is due.

Thanks goes to Jim Breen and Monash University, for without
Mr. Breen's dictionary files, J-Ben and countless other
programs like it would not exist.

Thanks also goes to Jim Rose of kanjicafe.com, for allowing me a
license to use the stroke order diagrams from his SODER project, and for
contributing files to support Jim Breen's projects (RADKFILE2/KRADFILE2).

Thanks to the wxWidgets team for developing wxWidgets, and to the
denizens of the wxForums (especially doublemax, but others as well).
Although J-Ben no longer uses wxWidgets, it did help me get off to
a good start.

Thanks to the GTK+ and GTKmm teams, both for their tools and their
support when things haven't worked quite as planned.

Thanks to "taniwha" at the "Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar"
forum.  Taniwha convinced me that integrating KanjiPad into J-Ben
was a low hanging fruit and worthwhile, and also pointed me towards
the im-ja project and the improvements they have made to KanjiPad.
Obviously, thanks also goes to the im-ja teams, Owen Taylor,
Robert Wells and Todd David Rudicks for their work on KanjiPad
and related programs.

And last (but certainly not least!), thanks to the users of J-Ben
and the feedback they have provided.

I hope that I haven't missed anyone here, but if I have, drop me a line:
