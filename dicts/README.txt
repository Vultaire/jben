This directory holds the dictionary data files for J-Ben.  Currently
J-Ben requires that these files are formatted in UTF-8, which any
of the dictionaries from vultaire.net should already be.  If you
are using a dictionary from elsewhere, it must first be converted.

If you need to convert such a file, there is a utility called iconv.
It's a command line tool with versions for both Linux and Windows.
The Linux version is often included in your distro already; the
Windows version can be found by searching for the GnuWin32 project
using your favorite search engine.
