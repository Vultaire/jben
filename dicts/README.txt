This directory holds the dictionary data files for J-Ben.  None are
included with the source distribution of J-Ben, since J-Ben uses the
exact copies distributed by Monash University.  If you need the
dictionaries, copy them from a binary distribution of J-Ben or
download them yourself from Jim Breen's page at Monash University:
http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/japanese.html

J-Ben REQUIRES the following:
edict2(.gz)
J-Ben also REQUIRES ONE OR MORE of the following:
kanjidic2.xml(.gz) - If found, the below two are not loaded.
kanjidic(.gz)
kanjd212(.gz)

These files may be left in gzip format (advised for KANJIDIC2), or
may be unzipped for faster loading.
