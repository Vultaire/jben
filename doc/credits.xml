  <para>
    J-Ben was written by Paul Goins.  It uses code from the im-ja and kanjipad
    projects, and those portions are copyrighted by their original authors.
    Code has also been directly contributed by Alain Bertrand.

  <para>
    I've had a lot of help writing this software from many people, and it
    goes without saying that this list will not be conclusive.  However,
    I want to try to give credit where credit is due.

  <para>
    Thanks goes to Jim Breen and Monash University, for without
    Mr. Breen's dictionary files, J-Ben and countless other
    programs like it would not exist.
  </para>

  <para>
    Thanks also goes to Jim Rose of kanjicafe.com, for allowing me a
    license to use the stroke order diagrams from his SODER project, and for
    contributing files to support Jim Breen's projects (RADKFILE2/KRADFILE2).
  </para>

  <para>
    Thanks to the wxWidgets team for developing wxWidgets, and to the
    denizens of the wxForums (especially doublemax, but others as well).
    Although J-Ben no longer uses wxWidgets, it did help me get off to
    a good start.
  </para>

  <para>
    Thanks to the GTK+ and GTKmm teams, both for their tools and their
    support when things haven't worked quite as planned.
  </para>

  <para>
    Thanks to "taniwha" at the "Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar"
    forum.  Taniwha convinced me that integrating KanjiPad into J-Ben
    was a low hanging fruit and worthwhile, and also pointed me towards
    the im-ja project and the improvements they have made to KanjiPad.
    Obviously, thanks also goes to the im-ja teams, Owen Taylor,
    Robert Wells and Todd David Rudicks for their work on KanjiPad
    and related programs.
  </para>

  <para>
    And last (but certainly not least!), thanks to the users of J-Ben
    and the feedback they have provided.
  </para>

  <para>
    I hope that I haven't missed anyone here, but if I have, drop me a line:
