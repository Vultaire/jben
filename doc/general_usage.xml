		<title>The Dictionaries</title>

		<para>
			J-Ben provides a bidirectional word dictionary and a kanji
			(character) dictionary. These dictionaries are dependent upon the
			freely available EDICT2 and KANJIDIC dictionary files from Monash
			University.
		</para>

			<title>The Word Dictionary</title>
			<para>
				The word dictionary performs a very simple search based upon the
				ENTIRE QUERY - it doesn't try to match all the words or some of
				the words, but rather treats your query as a phrase and matches
				only the whole phrase. Results are arranged with exact matches
				first, followed by "begins with" matches, "ends with" matches,
				and finally, everything else. Japanese searches work best
				because of the structure of EDICT2, but English searches work
				fairly well as well.
			</para>

			<para>
				The word dictionary ties into the <link linkend="vsl">vocab
				study list</link>. You can step through or jump to a random word
				in your vocab list using the buttons at the bottom of the
				dictionary tab.
			</para>

			<title>The Kanji (Character) Dictionary</title>

			<para>
				The kanji dictionary searches for one or more kanji characters
				and displays detailed information about each one. Because of
				the amount of data available for each character, and because
				most people don't need much of the data available, the output
				can be customized through the <link linkend="cfg">configuration
				tab</link>.
			</para>

			<para>
				Information provided includes (but is not limited to) the
				following:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>Japanese-style readings (kun-yomi) and
					"Chinese-style" sound-based readings (on-yomi)</listitem>
					<listitem>Special readings for use in names
					(nanori)</listitem>
					<listitem>Stroke count</listitem>
					<listitem>Jouyou grade level</listitem>
					<listitem>Dictionary reference codes</listitem>
					<listitem>Korean and "Pinyin" readings</listitem>
					<listitem>JIS and Unicode values in hexadecimal</listitem>
					<listitem>Various radical information</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>

			<para>
				Display of stroke order diagrams can be toggled here. This is
				dependent upon <link linkend="kksod_install">installing a set of
				stroke order diagrams</link>.
			</para>

			<para>
				The kanji dictionary ties into both the <link
				linkend="ksl">kanji</link> and <link linkend="vsl">vocab study
				lists</link>. You can move through your kanji study list using
				the forward, backward, and random buttons at the bottom of the
				dictionary tab. Further, if you search for a single kanji and
				it is in your list, the dictionary will recognize this and
				allow you to step through your list from the current character.
				Finally, all character searches are cross-referenced with your
				vocab study list, and if any of your vocab contain the kanji,
				they will be listed as well.

		<title>Kanji Drilling</title>

		<para>
			J-Ben provides an easy-to-use kanji "flash card" mode. After
			defining a <link linkend="ksl">kanji study list</link>, the Kanji
			Practice tab is enabled.  The kanji practice mode is intended as a
			basic self-study tool, and does not ask you to input any answers to
			questions or anything similar. It will display information about a
			kanji with some of the information hidden from view, and it is your
			job to guess, either mentally or on a separate sheet of paper, what
			the missing information is. After doing this, you can look at the
			hidden fields, and you decide for yourself whether or not you
			remembered the character properly or not. This is a self-graded
			test; you decide for each character whether you got it "Correct" or
			"Wrong", and the program will simply track your answers and help you
			study the ones you had trouble with.  The program will continue to
			drill you through the characters you mark as "Wrong", and at the end
			of the test will present you with a score and a list of the
			characters you got wrong.
		</para>

		<para>
			The first step in using this mode is to select which characters to
			test yourself on. You start by choosing how many characters you
			want to test, and then you pick whether to select the kanji randomly
			from your list or in order from a certain index of your list. The
			former method may be better for general review, while the latter
			would be good for practicing through sets of new characters in your
			list.
		</para>

		<para>
			The second step is choosing the type of test. If you want to
			practice writing characters by hand, you will probably want to try
			the "writing kanji" option. However, if just reading the characters
			is sufficient, which may be fairly true if you only read or type
			Japanese, then you might be better served focusing on "reading
			kanji".
		</para>

		<para>
			After clicking "Start Drill", test mode begins. While in test mode,
			you will not be allowed to change to other tabs in the program. The
			screen will display 4 textboxes containing information about the
			kanji: the character itself, its on-yomi (sound-based) reading, its
			kun-yomi (Japanese style) reading, and its meaning in English.
			Some of the textboxes will be covered up, depending on which test
			mode you chose: for "writing kanji" only the kanji character is
			covered, while for "reading kanji" everything except the kanji
			character is covered. You can uncover each of the textboxes simply
			by clicking on them.  After reviewing each flash card, you choose
			whether you got it "Correct" or "Wrong", and then the program will
			go to the next card in your list.
		</para>

		<para>
			After running through all of the flash cards, if you marked any of
			them as wrong, the program will continue to drill you through the
			ones you missed.  At this point your score won't change; this is
			just extra practice and if you want you can click "Stop Test" to
			skip it.  I recommend running through this, though.  The extra
			review ends once you've marked each kanji as "Correct".
		</para>

		<para>
			At the end of the test (or if you select "Stop Test"), the Test
			Results message box will appear.  It will tell you what your score
			was, how much of the test you finished, and which kanji you missed,
			if any.

			<title>The Kanji Study List</title>

			<para>
				The kanji study list is used for storing any kanji characters
				you are studying. It's used by the <link linkend="kdict">kanji
				dictionary</link> and is required for
				<link linkend="kdrill">kanji drilling mode</link>. This list
				can be added to and sorted based on newspaper frequency and
				Jouyou grade level.
			</para>

			<sect3>
				<title>Adding characters to the list</title>

				<para>
					If you don't know where to start on studying kanji, I
					personally recommend using the Kanji menu to add kanji to
					your list by Jouyou grade level. This is done by selecting
					Kanji -&gt; Add Kanji to List -&gt; By Jouyou Grade Level,
					and selecting a range of grades to add from the dialog which
					appears. Alternatively, you can select By Newspaper
					Frequency Ranking and choose kanji to add in that way.
				</para>

				<para>
					Alternatively, you can <link linkend="klistimport">import a
					list from a text file</link>, or you can <link
					linkend="klistedit">manually edit the list</link> using the
					Kanji Study List tab.
				</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="klistedit">
				<title>Manually editing the list</title>

				<para>
					The Kanji Study List tab lets you manually edit your kanji
					list. You can type kanji in by hand, or copy and paste them
					from another application.
				</para>

				<para>
					When you hit the Commit button, your changes are saved.
					Only kanji which are in the kanji dictionary will be
					retained; any other characters are discarded. Duplicates
					are also automatically removed. So, you could simply copy
					and paste a vocab list into the kanji list editor, hit
					commit, and you would end up with a list of all the kanji
					used in that list.
				</para>

				<para>
					If you don't like the changes you've made, just hit the
					Revert button, and the list will return to the way it was.
				</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3>
				<title>Sorting the list</title>

				<para>
					After adding characters to the list, it is strongly
					recommended to sort the list. Via the Kanji -&gt; Sort
					Kanji in List menu, you can sort your current study list by
					Jouyou grade level and newspaper frequency ranking.
					Currently you can only sort in ascending order.
				</para>

				<para>
					Personally, I like to apply both sorting methods. First I
					sort by newspaper ranking, so that the most common
					characters are first in the list. Next, I sort by Jouyou
					level. This will sort the characters from the lowest
					Jouyou level to the highest (with uncategorized characters
					at the very end). However, within the grade levels it will
					maintain the newspaper frequency sort, meaning that as I
					study each grade level, I'm exposed to the likely more
					important characters first.
				</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="klistimport">
				<title>Exporting and importing study lists</title>

				<para>
					The current kanji list can be exported to a plain text file
					using the Kanji -&gt; Save Kanji List to File... menu.
					Likewise, this text file (or any other plain text file) can
					be imported using the Kanji -&gt; Add Kanji to List -> From
					File... menu. However, you may want to <link
					linkend="klistclear">clear the study list</link> first.
				</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="klistclear">
				<title>Clearing the study list</title>

				<para>
					All operations on the kanji list are additive: even
					importing a list from a file doesn't replace the list, but
					rather just adds to it. In the case you actually want to
					replace the current kanji list with another, or just start
					from scratch, select Clear Kanji List from the Kanji menu.
				</para>

		<sect2 id="vsl">
			<title>The Vocab Study List</title>

			<para>
				The vocab study list is a newer feature and is primarily used
				as as cross-referencing resource for the kanji dictionary. Due
				to its lower importance, there is currently only one way to edit
				this list, and that is through the Words -&gt; Study List tab.
				The list is formatted with each line representing one Japanese
				word or phrase. Either manually type in the list, or copy and
				paste it from another program, and press Commit. That's it!
