	  <para>
		J-Ben is dependent on (at least) two different development packages.
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>wxWidgets: J-Ben is being developed using wxWidgets 2.8.7.
		  It may and probably will work on slightly earlier versions, but I
		  can't guarantee everything will work right.</listitem>
		  <listitem>The Boost Libraries: J-Ben should work with boost 1.34.1 or
		  later.</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	  </para>

	  <para>
		If building for Linux, you will also need a development package for:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>GTK+ 2: Tested using debian's libgtk2.0-dev package, version
		  2.12.1-1</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	  </para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
	  <title>Linux Users</title>

	  <para>Ensure you have the development packages for libboost and wxWidgets
	  installed. Then, just "make". There is no "make install" at this time,
	  sorry. It will be added later.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
	  <title>Windows Users</title>

	  <para>While Linux building should be mostly non-problematic, the Windows
	  build support is NOT robust. It's designed specifically for use with
	  MinGW without the MSYS environment.</para>

	  <para>
		If you want to give it a try, do the following:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>Ensure mingw's bin folder is in your path.</listitem>
		  <listitem>Install the coreutils and sed packages from the gnuwin32
		  project. This means the binaries and the dependencies. You'll probably
		  come across duplicate DLLs while unzipping these packages. This should
		  be okay, just keep the newer copy of any duplicate DLLs.</listitem>
		  <listitem>Make sure the coreutils/sed binaries are in your
		  path.</listitem>
		  <listitem>Change the 4 variables in the "WINDOWS-SPECIFIC" section of
		  the makefile as needed.</listitem>
		  <listitem>
			Build using the following command:
			<informalexample>
			  <programlisting>mingw32-make PLATFORM=windows</programlisting>
			</informalexample>
		  </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

	  <title>Expert: Canadian Cross Linux->Windows builds</title>
	  <note>Most people can safely skip this section.</note>
	  <para>To attempt a "canadian cross" build, run:
	  <informalexample>
		<programlisting>make CANUCK=1 PLATFORM=windows BUILD=&lt;release|debug|profile> \
CC=&lt;cross-compiling gcc> CXX=&lt;cross-compiling g++></programlisting>
	  </informalexample>
	  (This has not yet been tested; I'm working on it!)</para>

	<title>Installing J-Ben</title>

	<para>Currently there is no proper installer mechanism for the program; I've
	been mostly focused on the program itself since it is still quite lacking in
	several areas. I will address installation at a future date.</para>

	<para>For Windows users, adding a start menu shortcut should be a trivial
	affair, if desired. Just do it yourself.</para>

	<para>For Linux users, you could add the program's directory to your path
	via your ~/.bashrc file, or you could make a script like the
	following:</para>

	<informalexample><programlisting>#!/bin/sh
cd &lt;path_to_jben>
./jben</programlisting></informalexample>

	<para>Put that in /usr/bin or similar, do a chmod +x on it and that'll make
	things simpler.</para>
