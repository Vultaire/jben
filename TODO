* Change current dictionary edit boxes to drop-down boxes.  Store the last 10
  or so searches in the drop-down menu.  This list would be saved between
  program runs.  The size of these buffers can be adjusted through the config
  window.
* Add keyboard shortcuts to all major functions, callable from any J-Ben window:
  kanji search modes, kanji drill mode, jump to dictionary search box...
* Add local keyboard shortcuts to all buttons, as possible... especially on the
  kanji drill mode.
  (Update: This has now been done for kanji drill mode.  Thanks goes to Alain
  Bertrand.)
