* Change current dictionary edit boxes to drop-down boxes.  Store the last 10
  or so searches in the drop-down menu.  This list would be saved between
  program runs.  The size of these buffers can be adjusted through the config
  window.
* Add keyboard shortcuts to all major functions, callable from any J-Ben window:
  kanji search modes, kanji drill mdoe, jump to dictionary search box...
* Add local keyboard shortcuts to all buttons, as possible... especially on the
  kanji drill mode.

User suggestions:

* Alain Bertrand (Sat, 26 Apr 2008 19:36:00 +0000):
May I suggest you to add "one key only" keyboard shortcuts to "Correct" and
"Wrong" buttons to be able to use one hand to write the kanji and the other to
interact with jben.
