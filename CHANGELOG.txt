1.1.2:
* Integrated KanjiPad.  Code based on or borrowed from the KanjiPad code used by
  im-ja.  Accessible through Kanji -> Find Kanji -> By Handwriting.
* Major makefile changes.  Now supports normal Linux building as well as win32
  builds.  Win32 builds require MinGW with mingw32-make plus sed and coreutils
  from gnuwin32.  Include/lib dirs must be specified in the Makefile, but this
  should be a simple matter.  Finally, MSYS is NOT used by this makefile; it is
  run from a regular command prompt using mingw32-make.
* Updated EDICT2 and KANJIDIC to newer versions.
* Removed all the files in the old_files directory.  None of them are relevant
  any longer.
* Moved Code::Blocks build files to old_files.  With the new Windows make
  support, I think they're now obsolete, but I'll keep them around for a few
  more versions at least.
* Added README.txt, INSTALL.txt and CHANGELOG.txt to project.
