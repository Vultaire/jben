NOTE ABOUT NEWLINES: All .txt files distributed with J-Ben are saved
with DOS-style newlines, while source files are saved with UNIX-style
newlines since most development work is done under Linux.  This is
intentional.  I would normally save everything UNIX-style, but I want
the .txt files to show up properly in Windows Notepad.
